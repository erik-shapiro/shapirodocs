## General Guide
![](../images/hub360/searchform.PNG)
The Hub will always default to filtering for Shapiro360 documents. This can be changed via the dropdown to filter through **GLG/Transdocs**, **Customer Docs**, and **FPPI Authorizations**.

When searching for a File, a valid File ID must be provided. When filtering for a Customer Doc or an FPPI Authorization however, you must use a valid **CustNo** or **AgentNo**.

## File/Customer Detail

You can either click the area within the orange outline or drag files directly into it to begin processing documents.

To release these documents to upload a different batch, click Start Over on the bottom left of the Upload listing.

Documents will highlight in either red, yellow, or green.

* **Red** - Danger, this document has the same name as one already uploaded. If you do nothing, Hub360 will overwrite the old one.
* **Yellow** - Warning, this document's name doesn't quite match the naming convention. If you do nothing, Hub360 will rename the file on your behalf to match.
* **Green** - Accepted, no problems detected

Document Names can be edited by clicking the Edit Mode button on the top-left of the Upload Listing.

![](../images/hub360/rejected.PNG)
